Batch files for automatically creating minecraft servers.

## Create Minecraft Server.bat
This file is to create a vanilla minecraft server.\
To create the latest version server, copy the link from [minecraft's website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) that says minecraft_server.x.x.x.jar.\
The link will look like "https://â€‹piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/.../server.jar".\
Paste the link into the ServerFile variable.

You can change the amount of RAM used by the server in the variable at the top of the program.
